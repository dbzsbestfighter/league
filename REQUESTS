Two bots:
Registration RegBot  (maybe a different call name?)
Enforcement  LeagueBot


Registration:

!help -> lists all commands available to users
!about -> made by dbz (for bug reporting), python info/core, basic information about the bot's purpose

User/owner commands

!registerteam squad  -> creates and gives ownership to squad  | Bot has to check that user owns the squad
!removeplayer squad:name -> allows team owner to remove player manually. | Check ownership beforehand
!giveowner squad:newowner -> give squad to new player | check owner and new player are both on same squad.
!listplayers squad -> command is avail to everyone, shows complete list of players for squad, shows vp's and status
!vp player -> returns user's vp and current squad

REF/MOD/BOT OWNER Commands

!startleaguereg Leaguename -> starts a league and player registration, must be done prior to making teams
!stopleaguereg Leaguename -> stops registration (cut-off)
!removesquad squad -> deletes squad from league (option to delete an erroneous/invalid squad)
!removeleague leaguename -> deletes all rosters, players, and league data


Any more ideas for commands?
